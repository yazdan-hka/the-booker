# the-booker
Python program written in Sqlite3 and Selenium. i wrote this for myself to learn English and automate the process of searching the words one by one. when you read a book, you can enter the words you do not know the meaning of them and they are saved in database. then the program can find their meaning by scraping and stores them in database, and you can then perform CRUD on them.

you need a ChromWebdriver synched with your chrome version to run this program. you must place the webdriver in the same directory with main.py.
